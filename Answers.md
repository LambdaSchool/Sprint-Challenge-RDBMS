Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.

RDBMS is a database system that is based on relationships between tables and SQL is the programming language used to manipulate data in a RDBMS.

Why do tables need a primary key?
All tables need a primary key. 

What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
The name given is a foreign key. 

What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
We need to create another table that has the primary keys of both the tables. 

What SQL statement is used to retrieve data from a table?
The "select" statement is used: 
    Select * from (insert Name of Table)

What SQL clause is used to filter the results of a query?
    The "where" clause is used in addition to an operator to filter. 

What are views? Provide one example use case for them.
Views are the virtual tables that are the results of sql statement. An example would be an accountsreceivable view that includes all the relevant data that is needed such as the company id, name, receivables, aging, etc.
