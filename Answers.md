1. RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is the database software       itself, which manages storage, querying, updating, and everything else.
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language which is typically used to query the RDBMS.

2. A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column in unique.    

3. A foriegn key which is a column or combination of columns that is used to    establish and enforce a link between the data tables.

4. A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are      associated with multiple records in another table. This is usaually a        problem, but it can be fixed by using a join table.

5. The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

6. A WHERE clause is a condition that must be met in order for a row to be      returned in a query. It filters the results that match the condition.

7. A view is an object that is a virtual table that retrieves data from one     or more tables, similar to how a SELECT statement returns a data set. You    can use a view to provide backward compatibility to emulate a table that     has significantly changed or no longer exists.
