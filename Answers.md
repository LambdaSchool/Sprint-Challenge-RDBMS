## Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
- The RDBMS is the system, which manages storage, querying, updating etc. SQL is the language used to interact with the system.


## Why do tables need a `primary key`?
- Primary keys are important to prevent duplicate records from being created, and they allow clusters, joins, deletes etc.


## What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
- Foreign key.


## What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
- A _mapping table_ which stores the relationship between two tables to establish and build a many to many relationship.


## What SQL statement is used to retrieve data from a table?
- `Select  * from`


## What SQL clause is used to filter the results of a query?
- The _where_ clause.

## What are `views`? Provide one example use case for them.
- A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns, like a real table would. Fields in a view are fields from real tables in a database.
