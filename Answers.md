#Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.
*RDMS is a Relational Database Management System. SQL is a querying language to do things within that RDMS.*
#Why do tables need a primary key?
*Primary keys ensure that you don't have multiple records describing the same piece of data.*
#What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
*Foreign Key Restraint*
#What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
*In order to make a relationship 'many-to-many' the columns inside the table must link to multiple columns from other tables.*
#What SQL statement is used to retrieve data from a table?
*SELECT * from <table>*
#What SQL clause is used to filter the results of a query?
*WHERE (condition) in * as **
#What are views? Provide one example use case for them.
*A view is a SQL query stored as an object. You can select a large quantity of data and store them into convenient variables and save it as a view to make querying the database easier.*
