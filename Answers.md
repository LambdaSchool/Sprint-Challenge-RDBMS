1.	Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System- This is the software that stores and organizes the data. SQL stands for Structured Query Language- this is the language used to manipulate the data in the database.
2.	Why do tables need a primary key?
A primary key is used to ensure that data in a specific column is unique.
3.	What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table?
A Foreign key is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
4.	What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
In order to have a many to many relationship between two tables you need a third table called a junction (join) table.
5.	What SQL statement is used to retrieve data from a table?
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a table.
6.	What SQL clause is used to filter the results of a query?
The WHERE statement is used to filter the results of a query.
7.	What are views? Provide one example use case for them.
A view is a “virtual table” based on the result of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can query a view like you can a table. A view can combine data from two or more table, using joins.
