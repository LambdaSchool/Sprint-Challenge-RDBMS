1. SQL is one language used to manage DBs.  RDBMS can happen at multiple levels of abstraction (though as far as I know most boil down to SQL statements).

2. Tables need a primary key because it is their identifying feature.  It allows for easier comparison and alteration.

3. Foreign Key.

4. A intermediary table that allows for cross referencing of their features (by id).

5. SELECT (FROM) can be used retrieve data from a DB.

6. WHERE can be used to filter by particular conditions.

7. Views are saved queries on some subset of data.  They allow one to refer to certain important subsets repeatedly and make future queries quicker. This is useful for presenting data or restructuring it for particular uses.
