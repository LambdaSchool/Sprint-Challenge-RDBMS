1 - RDBMS refers to the database software itsef, where SQL is a language
used to query the RDBMS.

2 - Tables need a primary key to define them as unique and allow them 
to be connected to other tables.

3 - The table column that references another table's primary key is the
foreign key.

4 - In order to have a many to many relationship between two tables we
need to build a relation table.

5 - To retrieve data from a table we use the SELECT statement.

6 - To filter the result of a query we use the WHERE clause.

7 - Views display specific requested information from a database without
having to view the full database. An example of a view would be viewing 
just a user's posts as opposed to viewing the full user info.
