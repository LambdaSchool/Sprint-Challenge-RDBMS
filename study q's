1.  The difference between a Relational Database and SQL is that Relational Database is what holds the data and SQL
    is what interacts with the data.

2.  Tables need primary keys to identify each unique entry in a table.

3.  The name given to a table column that references a primary key is called a foriegn key.

4.  To have a many-to-many relationship, you would need primary keys & foriegn keys to match the primany keys.
