2 Why do tables need a primary key?
    tables need a primary key so that they can have a unique identifier that allows us to locate the information. It prevents SQL from returning errors.

    the name that references the primary key on another table is foreign key

4 What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables
    We would need either a third table or foreign key table for many relationships between two tables.
