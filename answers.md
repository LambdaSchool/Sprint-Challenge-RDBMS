## 1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
#### RDBMS is the software that runs the database, while SQL is a type of language that is used by RDBMS's
## 2. Why do tables need a `primary key`?
#### The primary key ensures that each row is unique and that each row is defined in a table.
## 3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
#### The name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table is a foreign key.
## 4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
#### To have a many to many relationship, you would need multiple records that are associated with multiple records in another table, so in these instances, a third table would be necessary.
