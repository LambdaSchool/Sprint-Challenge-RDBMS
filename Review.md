1.  Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.

    A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is the database software itself, which manages the storage, updating and querying of the data. Specifically, a RDBMS uses the relational model of data and relational model theory to store and manage data. Structured Query Language (SQL), is the language used to query the data in the RDBMS.

2.  Why do tables need a `primary key`?

    A primary key is important because it serves as a unique identifier for a row of data in a database table. A primary key makes it convenient for a user to add, sort, modify or delete data in a database and it ensures that each record is distinct from other records, which eliminates the possibility of duplicate data.

3.  What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key
    on another table.

    A Foreign Key

4.  What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two
    tables.

    SELECT
