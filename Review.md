You can exercise your Google-Fu for this and any other _Sprint Challenge_ in the future.

1.  Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a relational database which can be queried for data, and other associated programs used to manage and administrate that database. RDBMSs often use the Structured Query Language (SQL) as the language for querying the database. Such RDBMSs are said to implement SQL.

2.  Why do tables need a `primary key`?
The primary key is used to index the table so that data can be uniquely identified, as well as stored and retrieved efficiently.

3.  What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key
    on another table.
Foreign Key.

4.  What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two
    tables.
We use a separate table whose row represent a single relation (an association between a value in one table and a value in another). Thus each of the original tables can have multiple relations to the other table.

5.  What SQL statement is used to retrieve data from a table?
Select.

6.  What SQL clause is used to filter the results of a query?
Where.
