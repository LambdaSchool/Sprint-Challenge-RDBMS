1. Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.
        SQL is the basic language that is used to create databases. It has been around for ages, but this is because it is a good language to work with.
        It is simple to understand, and is used in conjunction with a RDBMS to provide the data needed for programmers.
        A RDBMS is a program that interprets, reads, and writes the SQL code. It is an in-between or middle-man for the user and SQL code.
        This management system will include methods and functions that will work to interpret the SQL code, and connect the database to other backend files, which in turn is used as a whole to connect information with front-end developers. 

2. Why do tables need a primary key?

    Primary keys are critical to place in entries in order for data to be identified by the person grabbing it.
    Primary keys are a way to give each item in the table a unique way (usually a number) to distinguish it from all the rest of the entries.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

    It is called a foreign key. The foreign key helps connect one database to another one that is related.
    For instance, a table of computer software could have a foreign id linking it to a specific class that is being taught.

4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

    Because of the type of relationship, foreign keys will not be very useful. If you have a many to many relationship,
    a secondary table will need to be the link between the other two tables. This will allow the two main tables to have shared data.
