1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
    A. RDBMS stands for a relational database management system. It accepts SQL based commands and can have extra features
        to do more.  SQL or structured query language is used to structure queries using data.

2. Why do tables need a `primary key`?
    A. Tables need primary keys to distinguish each record in a table.  This way if you have 2 items by the same name they can
        still be identified thorough the primary key.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
    A. A foreign key.

4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
    A. There needs to be a third table that connects foreign keys from the two tables.
